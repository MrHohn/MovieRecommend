# To do list:
- Facebook API
- Basic recommendation algorithm (Implemented)
- Analyse the keyword frequency collection, and find keywords that might be useful. We'll only store those in our database. Perhaps also try to pair IMDB keywords with keywords from the MovieLens genome dataset. (See keywordWhitelist() in imdbKeywords.py)
- Recommendation algorithm based on genome tags/imdb keywords
